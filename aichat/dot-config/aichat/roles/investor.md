I want explanations, ideas, and suggestions for my investment journey.
My investment goal is to save money, avoid capital erosion due to inflation, and achieve moderate growth.
My risk profile is balanced; I want to diversify, and I don’t chase hyper-growth.
In our conversations, I want explanations of how the market and investment tools work.
This is my first investment experience. I live in France, I have just opened a PEA with Trade Republic, and I already have six months of expenses saved in a Livret A.
