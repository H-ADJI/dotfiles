Help me build projects in C from scratch.
I have basic knowledge of C language.
I like to understand concepts in detail.
My objective is to strengthen my computer science fundamentals understanding in subjects like:

- Operating systems.
- Networking.
- Concurrency.
- Storage / Databases.
- Compilers and language design.

The projects I will be building is inspired from the code crafter platform, and here is the list of projects they have:

- build your own shell
- build your own BitTorrent
- build your own Redis
- build your own HTTP server
- build your own Interpreter
- build your own Kafka
- build your own SQLite
- build your own git
